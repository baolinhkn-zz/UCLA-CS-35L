2. I first made a new branch called "quote":
   git checkout v3.0 -b quote
3. I installed the change into the branch with the patch command:
   patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt
   patching file src/cmp.c
   patching file src/diff.c
   patching file src/diff3.c
   patching file src/dir.c
   patching file src/sdiff.c
   patching file src/util.c

   The patching is successful.
4. I now look into adding a ChangeLog entry with the emacs command C-x 4 a.
5. To compose a ChangeLog entry, I opened emacs and typed in the command C-x 4 a.
   I simply copied and pasted the appropriate entry from git-log.txt and used
   that as my ChangeLog entry. 
6. I can now commit my changes to the new branch and use the ChangeLog entry as
   my commit message with the following:
   git add .
   git commit -aF ChangeLog

7. I can now generate a patch file using the command:
   git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt
8. My partner for this part is Kubilay Agi.
   I first added his file in by having him use scp to copy his patch into my
   server. I then renamed his patch kubilay-patch.txt.
   I then made a new branch:
   git checkout -b 'partner' 'v3.0'
   I then applied kubilay's patch
   git am < kubilay-patch.txt
   Applying: 2017-12-01 Kubilay Yucel Agi <kubilay@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu>

   And now, I can check if it works.
   ./bootstrap
   patch -p0 < diffutils-gets.diff
   ./configure
   make
   I then ran 
   diff . -
   diff --help
   and I also ran 
   make check
   and it appears to work.   
9. I can now verify if my ChangeLog entry works by running the command
   make distdir
   After running, I see that a directory called diffutils-3.0.1-34b2 is created.
   I can see the ChangeLog in there and see that the first entry is my entry.
10. I ran 
    cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs
    gitk
    and saw the window in xQuartz. The files are attached.
