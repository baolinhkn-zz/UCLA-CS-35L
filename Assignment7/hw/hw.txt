1. If the other teams had been observing the bytes going across the network, it
still would have been secure because the bytes are encrypted. The messages sent
between the client and a server are encrypted at the sender level with the
symmetric encryption key and the recevier decrypts these messages with the same
session key. Thus, even though other teams may have been observing all the
bytes, they would have been encrypted with the session key.
       (1) If the person observing the keystrokes had been observing throughout
       the entire time, meaning when the files that are in question were creted,
       they would obviously know the content of the files. If they observed
       during the time when I was logging into the server, they would know my
       username and password and would be able to log into the server under my
       name.
       (2) If the person in question had access to the USB that I wsa booting
       off of, they would have access to the private key that I have saved in
       the system, rendering it useless.
2. gpg --verify simply verifies the signature of the document with the public
key. It has no information on the creator or the origin of the file. It does not
prove origin. Instead, we can rely on a third party such as a Certificate
Authority to ensure that the file in question is geniune.
