CS35L Lab 6
FILE: log.txt

My partner for this lab was Kubilay Agi.
I first logged into my BeagleBone using the command
sudo ssh root@192.168.7.2
I then enabled ssh by installing OpenSSH with the following commands:
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
sudo apt-get install openssh-client
I generated a public and private key using the command:
ssh-keygen
The password was saved in /root/.ssh, the default location.
The password I chose was cs35l.
I created a user for Kubilay using the command:
sudo useradd -d /home/kubilay -m kubilay
I then added a password for kubilay using the command:
sudo passwd kubilay
He then entered his password: kubilay.
I then created a .ssh directory for kubilay using the commands:
cd /home/kubilay
sudo mkdir .ssh
sudo chown -R kubilay .shh
sudo chmod 700 .ssh
After I finished setting up the server, I began to set up the client so that I
could access Kubilay's server.
I type in the following command: 
ssh-copy-id -i baolinh@172.30.36.138
so that I can add my public key to the ssh folder in Kubilay's server.
However, we had some issues so we chose to connect to a different network
CR3760-wifi
and generated new IP addresses:
My IP Address: 10.97.85.252
Kubilay's IP Address: 10.97.85.253
Kubilay also had to redo the set-up of my user account so now, my username on
his server is b and thus, I type in the corresponding command:
ssh-copy-id -i b@10.97.85.253
I then use the command 
ssh-add
to add the private key
I then use 
ssh b@172.30.36.138
to enter the server 
I use the command
touch hi_kubilay.txt
to test whether or not I can create a file on Kubilay's server and he can see
it.
It works!
