I first installed the coreutils-7.6.tar.gz file from the Assignment 3 site. I
then moved that file into a temporary directory I called coreutils in my working
directory. Once there, I unzipped the tar file by using the command
tar -xvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
When that was completed, I moved on to installing the coreutils 7.6 file by
looking at the INSTALL file in the coreutils-7.6 directory to see how to install
the file.
After reading the INSTALL file, I noted that in order to install the coreutils
files into the proper directory, I would have to use the flag --prefix=PREFIX in
the configure command. In order to ensure that the coreutils files were being
installed into my temporary directory, I used the command
./compile --prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/baolinh/Desktop/CS35L/Assignment3/coreutils
coreutils being the temporary directory I would put these files in.
This allows me to edit the coreutils-7.9 files because I would have write permissions.
Once that was complete, I used the commands
make
make install
to finish the installation of the file.
I checked that the bug appeared by using the commands
  ls -l /bin/bash
  ./ls -l /bin/bash
that gave me the following format of output:
For ls -l:
   -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 960632 Aug  3 06:36 /bin/bash
For ./ls -l: (the ls command from the coreutils 7.6 file)
    -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 960632 2017-08-03 06:36 /bin/bash
Our goal is to get the ./ls -l command to output the information in the
following format:
    -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 729040 Mar  2  2009 /bin/bash
which is the traditional Linux format.
To fix the error, I can patch the ls program directly, using the workaround
patch provided on the Assignment 3 site from Padraig Brady.
After looking at the patch, I see the edits that need to be made.
To make the patch, I can edit the ls.c file directly from the src directory.
I open the ls.c file in emacs and make the proper changes.
Once I've made the changes, I can go and recompile it by using the command:
make
which creates a new ls executable file based on the output:
  CC     ls.o
  CCLD   dir
  CCLD   vdir
  CCLD   ls
Once I've completed that, I go back and look at the command ./ls -l again.
I execute the command
  ./ls -l /bin/bash 
and get the following output:
  -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 960632 Aug  3 06:36 /bin/bash
It doesn't look like it fixes the patch but if we use the command
   ./ls -l
on the entire src directory, we can see that it indeed patches the bug,
especially if we look at older files:
   -rw-r--r-- 1 baolinh csugrad   2458 Sep  1  2009 yes.c
The older files will show the year while the newer files (or the files created
within this last year) will show the time created instead of the year.
I can test the patch formally by using the touch command as suggested on the
Assignment 3 page.
I use the following commands:
touch -t 9907151230 oldFile
touch new
to create two files, one created on 1999-07-17 at 12:30 and another created
right now.
I use the modified ls command on the files using the commands:
./ls -l old
./ls -l new

and get the following output:
-rw-r--r-- 1 baolinh csugrad 0 Jul 15  1999 oldFile
-rw-r--r-- 1 baolinh csugrad 0 Oct 12 11:48 newFile

The patch fixes the bug and we are done!
